/*
 
A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

// PHP is a Loosely Typed Language or Dynamically Typed Language

// what is the difference between statically typed and dynamically typed languages?
/*
 
 A programming language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. A language is dynamically typed if the type of a variable is checked during run-time.  
 
 Some examples of statically-typed languages are Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Scala, Kotlin, Fortran, Pascal, Rust, Go, COBOL, etc.

 Most modern programming languages are dynamically typed. Some examples of dynamically-typed languages are Python, Javascript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, R, Dart, Lua, Objective-C, etc.

// What is the difference between compiler or interpreter?
/*
 
 C, C++, C#, Java are compiler-based programming languages 

 PHP, PERL, Ruby are interpreter-based programming languages
